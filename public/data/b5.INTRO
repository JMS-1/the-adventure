Many years ago there was a space station named Babylon 5.
There are many stories on how and why it all ended in fire.
Most of the stories are of minor historical relevance
because so many details do not fit the reality. Let's for
example mention some TV series found in a parallel
universe around the local year 1997. In this example there is
a wrong statement on Centauri sexuality - in fact Centauri
have eleven tentacles but only three long ones and eight
being very short - and other differences. So what really
happened in the far past?
With a special time transmission facility you were sent
back to the time just before the end of the famous station.
Try to find out what was going wrong and try to fix it if
you can. You will only survive when you can. We can give
you no further advise or help only our best wishes.
Good luck so far and may the Force be with you - and don't
take life, the universe and all the rest to serious,
especially not in this adventure.
