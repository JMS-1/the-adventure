------------------------- That's all ------------------------

Well, I hope you've some fun wandering around in the Babylon
5 station. If you won: my honest congratulations, the solution 
is really not easy. If you loose: don't be said. The only goal
of the game is the game and to play and to have fun. Did it?
So you win, too.
